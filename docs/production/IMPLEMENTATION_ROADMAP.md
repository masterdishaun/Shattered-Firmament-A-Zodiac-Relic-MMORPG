# Implementation Roadmap and Release Gates

## Phase 0 — Repository and documentation control

- Establish this repository as source of truth.
- Publish charter, gameplay baseline, story bible, faction quest catalogue, economy spec, architecture and ADRs.
- Define documentation, content, issue, branch and review conventions.
  **Exit:** canonical decisions discoverable from README; contradictions reconciled.

## Phase 1 — Workspace/toolchain genesis

- pnpm workspace with `shared/` and `server/`; Godot project under `client/`.
- Formatting, lint, type check, unit tests and CI.
- Development environment and secret-free environment examples.
  **Exit:** clean install/build/typecheck/test/lint and truthful CI results.

## Phase 2 — Shared contracts and content schema

- Schemas for factions, quests, items, characters, progression, zones, dungeon/boss definitions, inventory, loot, trade and rewards.
- Validate content; detect duplicate IDs, missing prerequisites, cycles, invalid ranges and faction-exclusive essential progression.
  **Exit:** content validation and contract tests pass.

## Phase 3 — Persistence

- Review PostgreSQL migration, add migration runner and test-database workflow.
- Ownership, session, join ticket, currency/item ledger, quest, profession and inventory invariants.
- Idempotent transactions, rollback, backup/restore.
  **Exit:** real PostgreSQL integration tests prove constraints and recovery.

## Phase 4 — Authentication/character flow

- HTTPS auth, refresh-token rotation/revocation.
- Character create/list/select and designated faction spawn resolution.
- Short-lived one-time join ticket bound to account, character, destination, audience and protocol version.
  **Exit:** ownership, replay, expiry, concurrency, rate-limit and audit tests pass.

## Phase 5 — Authoritative real-time foundation

- Colyseus room admission, lifecycle and reconnects; target 20 Hz loop.
- Server-owned movement, collision, safe-zone rules and snapshots.
- Interest management and performance instrumentation.
  **Exit:** adversarial input tests and initial load benchmark pass.

## Phase 6 — Isometric vertical slice

- One isometric blockout, controllable 3D character, camera and collisions.
- Faction selection and at least one start flow.
- One quest chain, enemy encounter, server-authoritative XP/inventory and solo dungeon.
- Godot web/native export validation.
  **Exit:** playable end-to-end slice and performance profile.

## Phase 7 — Three faction starts and narrative runtime

- Three distinct starting regions, introductory dungeons, mentors and faction quest chains.
- Data-driven dialogue/quest choices, versioning, localisation and telemetry.
  **Exit:** no broken prerequisites; faction access tests pass; essential progression remains shared.

## Phase 8 — Economy and content systems

- Professions, currency ledger, crafting, marketplace, personal loot and bad-luck protection.
- Party dungeons and difficulty scaling.
  **Exit:** economy simulation and replay/duplication exploit tests pass.

## Phase 9 — PvP, bosses and scale

- Always-on designated PvP zones, contested objectives and safe-zone transitions.
- Scheduled world bosses and fair reward contribution.
  **Exit:** safe-zone exploit, reward-fairness and concurrency/load tests pass.

## Phase 10 — Closed test and launch readiness

- Progression/economy research, PvP/class/gear balance and stress tests.
- Privacy/security review, crash analytics, backups/restore drills, maintenance mode and sunset policy.
  **Exit:** explicit sign-off; unresolved critical security, data-loss or performance issues block launch.

## Status reporting

Every report distinguishes implemented, locally tested, integration-tested, load-tested, Godot-export-tested, deployed and production-verified. Never collapse these into a generic “done”.
